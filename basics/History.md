History of Javascript 
1. In 1995, Brandon Eich developed a scripting language in just 10 days
2. Orginal name -> Mocha, then to -> Livescript
3. For marketing purpose changed to JavaScript 

Mocha --> livescript --> javascript 

4. In 1997, there is another famous browser that was Internet Explorer (Microsoft's browser). Then, Micrsoft copied javascript's features in order to make their own language named as Jscript 

5. In browser war (Netscape vs Internet Explorer)
    Netscape --> Javascript 
    Internet Explorer --> Jscript 

***Ecmascript is born***

6. Ecma International: Ecma international is an industry association founded in 1996, dedicated to the standardization of information and communication systems. 

***Javascript + Ecma (Rules) --> Ecmascript***

**Problem solved: We can now implement scripting language for different browsers.**

7. First Ecmascript: ES1 -> 1997 
   
   ES5 --> 2009 (lots of new features)

***ES6 (ES2015) --> 2015 (BIGGEST UPDATE FOR JS), ES6 is also known as Modern Javascript ***

8. Ecma has a technical community known as TC39 had decided that after 2015, they will release javascript with new features every year (annual release).
